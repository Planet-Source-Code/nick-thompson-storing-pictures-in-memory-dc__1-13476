## Storing Pictures in memory DC


</div>

### Description

Ever wondered how to store images in memory instead of picture boxes. I will show you the few lines of code needed. Its simple, much faster than using picture boxes plus you can create the ?DC's at run time, doing that with pictureboxes is almost impossible. Great for games. Demonstrates bitblt 'ing out to the form from them
 
### More Info
 
Basic API knowledge in useful

You can run out of memory if you do not exit the program with the proper exit since that does not release the memory.
